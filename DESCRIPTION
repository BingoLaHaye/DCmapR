Description: More about what it does (maybe more than one line)
    DCmapR's purpose is to aid in mapping Washington DC's wards and precincts as well as labeling them and 
    plotting spatial data points. This package works with many different mapping packages, such as leaflet,
    ggplot2 and Plotly/Mapbox. You are also welcome to attatch the dataframes with others to add more detail to the region.
    The idea came from CUA's 2nd Hackathon for social good and was used to map crime data in the different wards compared to voter data.
    The original data comes from Opendata.dc.gov
